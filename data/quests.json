Vegetable-Focused Sandwich: Remove excess moisture from vegetables, consider roasting vegetables for depth, layer for stability and balance, include protein element (hummus, cheese, egg), add spreads with complementary flavors, season vegetables separately before assembly. Open-Faced Melt: Toast bread before topping, layer fillings, ending with cheese, broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, watch carefully to prevent burning, finish with fresh components after melting. Wrap or Roll-Up: Warm tortilla or wrap for flexibility, apply thin layer of spread to entire surface, arrange fillings on bottom third, don't overfill, fold sides in, then roll from bottom, toast seam-side down to seal if desired. Breakfast-Style Sandwich: Cook egg to desired doneness, toast bread or English muffin, layer with breakfast meat if using, add cheese while egg is hot for melting, consider avocado or greens for freshness."
